## Why Python?

While MATLAB is a traditional tool in engineering, Python has become the industry standard in modern robotics, machine learning, and data science. By learning Python, you are acquiring a versatile skill that is highly sought after in today's tech landscape. It's free, open-source, and has a vast ecosystem of libraries that we will leverage throughout this course.

## Software Setup

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following installed on your system. We highly recommend installing the **Anaconda Distribution**, which packages Python and all the necessary libraries together.

*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Matplotlib:** For plotting and visualization.
*   **SymPy:** For symbolic mathematics (algebra and calculus).
*   **SciPy:** For scientific computing, including optimization.

You can run the code in this book interactively by using a **Jupyter Notebook** or an IDE like **Spyder** or **VS Code** with Python extensions.
