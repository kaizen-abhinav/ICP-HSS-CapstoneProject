This experiment demonstrates this powerful technique.\n\n## Experiment 7: Solving Differential Equations with Laplace Transforms\n\n\n### Aim\nTo solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the Laplace Transform method and to visualize the resulting solution.\n\n### Objectives\n*   To understand the process of transforming an entire ODE into the s-domain.\n*   To solve for the system's response algebraically in the s-domain.\n*   To use the Inverse Laplace Transform to bring the solution back into the time domain.\n*   To obtain and visualize both the symbolic and numerical solutions.\n\n---\n\n### Algorithm: The Laplace Transform Method for ODEs\n\nThe process follows a clear, three-step \"detour\" through the s-domain:\n\n1.  **Transform:** Take the Laplace Transform of every term in the differential equation. Use the transform properties for derivatives:\n    *   $\\mathcal{L}\\{y'(t)\\} = sY(s) - y(0)$\n    *   $\\mathcal{L}\\{y''(t)\\} = s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)$\n    This step converts the ODE into an algebraic equation in terms of $Y(s)$, automatically incorporating the initial conditions.\n\n2.  **Solve Algebraically:** Rearrange the resulting algebraic equation to solve for $Y(s)$. This $Y(s)$ is the Laplace Transform of the solution to the ODE.\n\n3.  **Inverse Transform:** Apply the Inverse Laplace Transform to $Y(s)$ to find the final solution, $y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\}$.\n\nThis method elegantly bypasses the need for finding homogeneous and particular solutions, as is done in traditional time-domain methods.\n\n---\n\n### Case Study: First-Order RC Circuit Model\n\n**Problem:** Using the Laplace Transform, find the solution of the differential equation $y' + y = 1$ with the initial condition $y(0)=0$. This equation models the voltage across a capacitor in a simple RC circuit (with R=1, C=1) connected to a 1V DC source.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1.  **Transform the ODE:**\n    *   $\\mathcal{L}\\{y'(t)\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{1\\}$\n    *   $\\left[ sY(s) - y(0) \\right] + Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$\n\n2.  **Incorporate Initial Conditions and Solve for Y(s):**\n\n    *   Since $y(0)=0$, the equation becomes: $sY(s) + Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$\n    *   Factor out $Y(s)$: $Y(s)(s + 1) = \\frac{1}{s}$\n    *   Solve for $Y(s)$: $Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s(s+1)}$\n\n3.  **Inverse Transform:**\n\n    *   Find $y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s(s+1)}\\right\\}$. This can be done using partial fraction expansion, yielding $y(t) = 1 - e^{-t}$.\n\nLet's verify this process using Python.\n\n::: {#fig-laplace-ode-1st .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.

The visualization confirms the behavior described by this function:\nThe solution curve starts at the point $(0,0)$, satisfying the initial condition $y(0)=0$. As time t increases, the exponential term $e^{−t}$ decays towards zero. Consequently, the solution $y(t)$  asymptotically approaches the value of 1, which is the steady-state response of the system. This behavior is characteristic of a first-order system (like an RC circuit) responding to a step input.\n\n### Application Problem: Mass-Spring-Damper System\n\nIn robotics and mechanical engineering, a mass-spring-damper system is a fundamental model for oscillatory behavior, such as a robot arm with flexibility or a vehicle's suspension.\nGoverning Equation: The motion of the mass $y(t)$ is described by the second-order linear ODE:\n$$\nmy''(t)+cy'(t)+ky(t)=F(t)\n$$\n\nYour Task:\n\nSolve for the motion of a system with the following parameters:\n- Mass (m): 1 kg\n- Damping coefficient (c): 2 Ns/m (This represents friction/drag)\n- Spring constant (k): 5 N/m\n- External Force (F(t)): 0 (The system is disturbed and then left alone)\n- Initial Conditions: The system is pulled from its equilibrium position and released from rest.\n\nInitial position: $y(0)=1$ meter\nInitial velocity: $y'(0)=0$ m/s\n\nUse the Laplace Transform method in `SymPy` to find and visualize the displacement $y(t)$.\n\n>Solution to the Application Problem: Mass-Spring-Damper System\n\nWe will now solve the second-order ODE for the mass-spring-damper system using the same `sympy.dsolve` method, which internally uses the Laplace transform technique.\n\n**Problem Recap:**\n\n*   **Equation:** $1 \\cdot y''(t) + 2 \\cdot y'(t) + 5 \\cdot y(t) = 0$\n*   **Initial Conditions:** $y(0) = 1$, $y'(0) = 0$\n\n**Manual Laplace Transform Steps (for understanding):**\n\n1.  **Transform the ODE:**\n\n    - $\\mathcal{L}\\{y''\\} + 2\\mathcal{L}\\{y'\\} + 5\\mathcal{L}\\{y\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{0\\}$\n    - $\\left[s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)\\right] + 2\\left[sY(s) - y(0)\\right] + 5Y(s) = 0$\n2.  **Incorporate Initial Conditions:**\n\n    - $\\left[s^2Y(s) - s(1) - 0\\right] + 2\\left[sY(s) - 1\\right] + 5Y(s) = 0$\n    - $s^2Y(s) - s + 2sY(s) - 2 + 5Y(s) = 0$\n3.  **Solve for Y(s):**\n\n    - $Y(s)(s^2 + 2s + 5) = s + 2$\n    - $Y(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s^2 + 2s + 5}$\n\n4.  **Inverse Transform:**\n    Find $y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{s+2}{s^2 + 2s + 5} \\right\\}$. This requires completing the square in the denominator and using the transform pairs for damped sinusoids.\n\nLet's use Python to perform these steps automatically and visualize the result.\n\n#### Python Implementation\n\n::: {#fig-laplace-ode-2nd .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.

This mathematical form is characteristic of an underdamped second-order system. It consists of two parts:\n\n- Oscillatory Part: $y(t)=(\\sin(2t)+\\cos(2t))e^{-t}$ represents the natural oscillation of the mass on the spring. The frequency of this oscillation is $\\omega=2$ rad/s.\n\n- Decay Part: $e^{-t}$ is an exponential decay envelope that multiplies the oscillation. This term represents the effect of the damper (friction), which removes energy from the system over time.\n\n- Visual Analysis: The plot clearly visualizes this behavior.\n\n- Initial Conditions: The curve starts at $y=1$ and its initial slope is zero (horizontal), perfectly matching the initial conditions  $y(0)=0$, and $y'(0)=0$.\n\n- Oscillation: The mass oscillates back and forth around its equilibrium position ($y=0$).\nDamping: The amplitude of these oscillations is not constant; it progressively decreases over time, confined within the black dashed lines representing the damping envelope. Eventually, the mass will come to rest at $y=0$. \n\n- Engineering Significance: This result is fundamental in control systems and robotics. If this were a robot arm, this \"ringing\" or oscillation after a command might be undesirable. An engineer would use this model to perhaps increase the damping ($c\\_damp$) to achieve a critically damped or overdamped response, where the arm moves to its target position smoothly without overshooting and oscillating. The Laplace Transform method is the cornerstone of this type of analysis.\n\n## Experiment 8: Laplace Transforms of Piecewise and Impulse Functions\n\nIn engineering, signals are not always smooth, continuous functions. They often involve abrupt changes, switching on or off, or extremely short, high-energy events. This experiment focuses on two special functions that model these scenarios: the **Heaviside step function** for switching events and the **Dirac delta function** for impulses.\n\n### Aim\n\nTo evaluate and visualize the Laplace Transform of common piecewise and impulse functions.\n\n### Objectives\n*   To define piecewise functions in SymPy.\n*   To understand the Laplace transform of the Heavyside (unit step) and Dirac delta (unit impulse) functions.\n*   To apply these concepts to analyze the response of an electrical circuit to an impulsive input.\n\n---\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1.  **Import Libraries:** Import `sympy`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.\n2.  **Define Symbols:** Define the symbolic variables for time (`t`) and complex frequency (`s`).\n3.  **Define the Piecewise Function:** Use SymPy's `sp.Piecewise`, `sp.Heaviside`, or `sp.DiracDelta` to construct the function in the time domain. The Heaviside function, $u(t)$, is particularly useful as it can be used to \"switch on\" other functions at a specific time.\n4.  **Compute Laplace Transform:** Use `sp.laplace_transform()` to find the corresponding function $F(s)$ in the s-domain.\n5.  **Visualize:** Create plots of both the original function $f(t)$ and its transform $F(s)$ to understand the relationship between the two domains.\n\n---\n\n### Case Study: The Unit Step Function\n\n**Problem:** Evaluate the Laplace transform of the Heaviside unit step function, $f(t) = u(t)$, and visualize it. The unit step function is formally defined as:\n$$\nf(t) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } t < 0 \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } t \\ge 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function represents an input that is turned on to a value of 1 at $t=0$ and stays on forever.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-heaviside .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1. & 2.

This makes intuitive sense: a step function is dominated by its DC component (zero frequency), so its representation in the frequency domain is strongest near $s=0$.\n\n### Application Challenge: RL Circuit Response to a Voltage Pulse\n\nInstead of an instantaneous impulse, let's consider a more realistic scenario where a voltage is applied for a fixed duration. This creates a rectangular voltage pulse.\n\n#### Your Task\nModel the same RL circuit ($R=10 \\Omega$, $L=1 H$) but change the input voltage. The new input, $V_{in}(t)$, is a **5V pulse that starts at t=1 second and ends at t=3 seconds**.\n*   **Input Voltage:**\n    $$\n    V_{in}(t) = \\begin{cases} 0 & t < 1 \\\\ 5 & 1 \\le t < 3 \\\\ 0 & t \\ge 3 \\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n*   **Governing Equation:** $L \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + R i(t) = V_{in}(t)$\n\n*   **Initial Condition:** The circuit starts with zero current, $i(0)=0$.\n\nFind and visualize the current response $i(t)$.\n\n#### The Challenge\n\n1.  Represent the rectangular voltage pulse, $V_{in}(t)$, using a combination of two Heaviside step functions.\n\n2.  Set up the differential equation in SymPy with this new input.\n\n3.  Use `dsolve` with the initial condition to find the symbolic solution for the current, $i(t)$.\n\n4.  Plot both the input voltage pulse and the resulting current on the same graph to see the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n#### Hint\n\nA pulse that turns on at $t=a$ and off at $t=b$ with height `H` can be constructed as:\n$f(t) = H \\cdot [u(t-a) - u(t-b)]$.\nIn `SymPy`, this would be `H * (sp.Heaviside(t - a) - sp.Heaviside(t - b))`.\n\n---\n\n### Solution to the Application Challenge\n\nHere is the complete Python implementation and analysis for the RL circuit's response to the defined voltage pulse.\n\n#### Python Implementation\n\n::: {#fig-pulse-response .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.

This is the correct mathematical representation, as the behavior of the current is described by different equations during different time intervals, corresponding to when the voltage is off, on, and off again.\n\n- Visual Analysis & Physical Interpretation: The plot clearly shows three distinct phases of behavior:\nPhase 1 ($0 \\leq t < 1$): The input voltage is zero. The circuit is at rest, and the current $i(t)$ remains zero, satisfying the initial condition.\n\n- Phase 2 ($1 \\leq t < 3$): The 5V pulse is applied. The current begins to rise exponentially, following the characteristic charging curve of an RL circuit. It aims for a steady-state value of $I \n_{max} =\\frac{V}{R}=5V/10\\Omega =0.5A$. However, the voltage is turned off before it can reach this steady state.\n\n- Phase 3 ($t \\geq 3$): The input voltage drops back to zero. The inductor, which had stored energy in its magnetic field, now acts as a temporary source. It forces the current to continue flowing, but with the circuit now closed and the external source gone, the current decays exponentially as the stored energy is dissipated by the resistor.\n\n- Engineering Significance: This simulation is extremely practical. It models how a digital logic signal (a pulse) affects an inductive load like a relay or motor winding. The solution shows that the current doesn't instantaneously follow the voltage; there is a lag due to the inductor's opposition to a change in current. It also demonstrates that even after the input signal is removed, a current can persist for a short time, a crucial consideration for timing in high-speed circuits. The use of Heaviside functions provides a powerful and elegant way to model and analyze these common switching phenomena.\n\n",
