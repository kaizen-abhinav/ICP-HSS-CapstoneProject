We will solve the **1D Linear Advection Equation**, a fundamental model for wave motion.\n\n**Governing Equation:**\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + c \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n\nHere, `u(x, t)` is the quantity that is moving (e.g., the height of a water wave or the stress in a rod), `x` is position, `t` is time, and `c` is the constant speed at which the wave travels.\n\n### Aim\nTo solve the one-dimensional wave equation using the **Upwind Method** and compare the numerical result with the initial condition.\n\n### Objectives\n*   To learn how to solve partial differential equations using numerical methods.\n*   To understand and apply the Finite Difference Method for hyperbolic equations.\n*   To observe how a wave profile moves with time.\n*   To write and run a Python program for the simulation.\n\n### The Upwind Method Algorithm\n\nThe \"upwind\" name comes from the fact that for a wave moving to the right (c > 0), we use information from the \"upwind\" direction (the left side, `i-1`) to determine the state at the next time step.\n\n1.  **Discretize Domain:** Set the number of space points (`nx`) and time steps (`nt`). Define the domain length (`Lx`) and total time (`T`). Calculate the step sizes $dx = \\dfrac{Lx}{(nx - 1)}$ and $dt = \\dfrac{T}{nt}$.\n2.  **Check Stability (CFL Condition):** Compute the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number, $\\lambda = c \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$. For the explicit upwind scheme to be stable, we must have $\\lambda \\le 1$. This means the numerical wave speed (`dx/dt`) must be faster than the physical wave speed (`c`), so the calculation can \"keep up\" with the phenomenon.\n3.  **Set Initial Condition:** Define the initial shape of the wave, `u(x, 0)`.\n4.  **Time Marching Loop:** For each time step `n`, iterate through all spatial points `i` and apply the upwind formula to find the wave's new state `u_new`. The discretized formula is:\n    $$ u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\lambda (u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n) $$\n5.  **Update:** Set `u = u_new`.\n6.  **Visualize:** Plot the final wave profile against the initial one.\n\n\n\n### Case Study: Exponential Decay Wave\n\nLet's simulate the equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$ (so `c=1`) with the initial condition $u(x, 0) = e^{-x}$.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-upwind-exp .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.

The Courant number $\\lambda=c\\dfrac{dt}{dx}$ was maintained within the stability range ($\\lambda\\leq 1$), ensuring a stable and oscillation-free result.\nHowever, we can observe two key phenomena characteristic of this first-order scheme:\n\n- Numerical Diffusion: The final wave shape is \"smeared\" or smoothed out compared to the initial condition. The sharp features are dampened. This is artificial damping introduced by the numerical method itself.\n- Amplitude Decay: The peak of the wave seems to decrease slightly.\n\nDespite these inaccuracies, the upwind scheme is computationally simple and robust, making it effective for simulating basic convection phenomena where the general transport behavior is more important than preserving the exact shape of the wave.\n\n## Application Problem: Stress Wave in a Rod\n\nIn mechanical systems, like long slender rods or beams, stress waves travel due to sudden loads or impacts. When a rod is struck at one end, a wave of stress and strain travels along its length. This can be modeled using the same 1D advection equation.\n\n**Task:** Modify the code above to simulate a \"square pulse\" stress wave.\n\nGoverning Equation: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+c\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=0$.\n\nInitial Condition: A square pulse representing a localized impact.\n\n$$u(x,0)=\\begin{cases} 1&; 0.4\\leq x\\leq 0.6\\\\ 0&; \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$$\n\nYour Challenge:\n\n- Copy the Python code block from the previous example.\n- Change the line that sets the initial condition u to create the square pulse described above.\nHint: You can use NumPy's logical indexing. For example: `u[ (x >= 0.4) & (x <= 0.6) ] = 1.0`. You will need to initialize u as an array of zeros first: `u = np.zeros(nx)`.\n- Re-run the simulation. Observe how the sharp corners of the square wave are smoothed out due to numerical diffusion.\n\n#### Solution to the Application Problem: Stress Wave in a Rod\n\nHere, we apply the same Upwind Method to the practical problem of a stress wave propagating through a mechanical rod. The initial condition is a square pulse, which could represent a short, sharp impact from a hammer strike on a specific section of the rod.\n\n> Python Implementation\n\nThe core algorithm remains the same. The only change is in how we define the initial condition `u(x, 0)`.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-upwind-square .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.

The leading edge of the numerical solution is centered around the correct analytical position (x = 1.4 for the start of the pulse), confirming that the model correctly captures the fundamental advection behavior at speed c=1 over time T=1.\n\n*Numerical Diffusion:* The most striking feature of the result is the severe smoothing of the square pulse. The sharp, vertical edges of the initial condition have been transformed into gentle slopes. The flat top of the pulse has become rounded and its peak amplitude has decreased from 1.0 to approximately 0.75. This is a classic and pronounced example of numerical diffusion, an error inherent in the first-order upwind scheme. The scheme struggles to resolve sharp gradients (discontinuities), so it effectively \"smears\" them out over several grid points.\n\n*Practical Implications:* In a real engineering scenario, if we needed to know the exact peak stress and its precise location, this simple method would be inadequate. The predicted peak stress is significantly lower than the actual initial stress, which could lead to an incorrect safety assessment.\n\n*Improving the Model:* While the upwind scheme is simple, its diffusive nature is a major drawback for problems requiring high accuracy. To improve the result and preserve the sharpness of the wave, engineers would use:\n\n- Higher-Order Schemes: Methods like the Lax-Wendroff scheme or flux-limiter methods are designed to be less diffusive and capture sharp fronts more accurately.\n- Finer Grid: Reducing dx and dt (while keeping lambda stable) can decrease the amount of diffusion, but at a significant computational cost.\n\n#### Result\n\nThe application simulation successfully models the physical propagation of a stress wave. However, it also serves as a crucial lesson in computational engineering: every numerical method has inherent errors and limitations. The Upwind Method, while stable and simple, introduces significant numerical diffusion that must be considered when interpreting the results.\n\n----\n\n## ID Heat Equation- Theoretical Background\n\n{{<video https://youtu.be/i8rnEl8O-r0?si=cB82MUHLk7RYTSzi>}}\n\n## Experiment 3: Solving the 1D Heat Equation\n\nThis experiment introduces the numerical solution of a *parabolic* partial differential equation: the one-dimensional heat equation. This equation is fundamental to understanding diffusion processes, not just in heat transfer but also in chemical concentration gradients and other physical phenomena.\n\n### Aim\nTo solve the one-dimensional heat conduction equation using the *Finite Difference Method (explicit scheme)* in `Python` and to visualize the temperature distribution over time.\n\n### Objectives\n*   To understand the physical interpretation of the one-dimensional heat equation.\n*   To discretize the heat equation using the *Forward Time Centred Space (FTCS)* scheme.\n*   To implement the finite difference method in `Python`.\n*   To analyze the stability condition required for this numerical method.\n*   To visualize the temperature profiles at different time levels.\n\n\n\n### Governing Equation and Discretization\n\nThe one-dimensional heat equation describes how temperature `u` evolves at a position `x` and time `t`. It is given by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity of the material, a constant that indicates how quickly the material conducts heat.\n\nTo solve this numerically, we use the *FTCS* method. We approximate the derivatives with finite differences:\n*   *Time Derivative (Forward Difference):* $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t}$\n*   *Space Derivative (Centred Difference):* $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}$\n\nHere, the superscript `n` denotes the time level and the subscript `i` denotes the spatial grid point. Substituting these into the governing equation and rearranging for the future temperature $u_i^{n+1}$, we get the explicit update formula.\n\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1.  **Initialize Parameters:** Set the values for the rod length `L`, total simulation time `T`, number of spatial nodes $n_x$, number of time steps $n_t$, and thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$.\n\n2.  **Discretize the Domain:** Calculate the step sizes for space and time.\n    *   Space step: $\\Delta x = \\frac{L}{n_x - 1}$\n    *   Time step: $\\Delta t = \\frac{T}{n_t}$\n\n3.  **Check Stability Condition:** Calculate the stability parameter, `r`. For the FTCS scheme to be stable and produce a physically realistic result, this value **must be less than or equal to 0.5**.\n    $$\n    r = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le 0.5\n    $$\n\n4.  **Set Initial and Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   Define the initial temperature distribution along the rod, $u(x, 0)$.\n    *   Apply boundary conditions. In this case, we use **Dirichlet boundary conditions**, which means the temperature at the ends of the rod is fixed for all time (e.g., $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$).\n\n5.  **Iterate Over Time:** For each time step `n`, loop through all the *interior* spatial points `i` and update their temperature using the FTCS formula:\n    $$\n    u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + r \\left( u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n \\right)\n    $$\n\n6.  **Output and Visualization:** Store the temperature profiles at different time intervals and plot them to visualize the heat diffusion process.\n\n\n\n### Sample Problem and `Python` Implementation\n\n**Problem:** Solve the 1D heat equation on a rod of length L=1.0 m with the following conditions: The temperature is zero everywhere except at the very center, where an initial \"heat pulse\" of 100°C is applied. The ends of the rod are kept at a constant 0°C for all time.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-heat-equation-explicit .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.

This exercise simulates heat dissipation in a longer structural beam with a more intense initial heat source.\n\n>Your Task\n\nSimulate the 1D heat equation on a rod with the following new conditions:\n\n*   *Rod Length (L):* 3.2 meters\n*   *Initial Condition:* The temperature is 0°C everywhere except for a single point at the very center, which has an intense initial temperature of *300°C*.\n*   *Boundary Conditions:* The ends of the rod are maintained at 0°C (Dirichlet BC).\n*   *Material:* Assume the same thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha = 0.01$.\n*   *Simulation Time (T):* Run the simulation for a longer time, `T = 2.0` seconds, to observe more significant diffusion.\n\n>The Challenge\n\n1.  Copy the `Python` code from the previous example.\n2.  Modify the parameter values (`L`, `T`, and the initial temperature pulse).\n3.  *Crucially*, after changing `L` and `T`, you must *re-calculate the stability parameter `r`*. If `r > 0.5`, the simulation will fail! You will need to adjust either `nx` (number of space points) or `nt` (number of time steps) to bring `r` back into the stable region ($\\le 0.5$). The goal is to find a stable combination.\n\n>Hint: \nThe stability parameter is $r = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$.\n\n* If your `r` value is too high, you have two options to decrease it:\n* *Increase `nt`:* This makes the time step `Δt` smaller, which is the most direct way to lower `r`.\n* *Decrease `nx`:* This makes the space step `Δx` larger. While this also works, it reduces the spatial resolution of your simulation.\n\nTry increasing `nt` first. A good starting point would be to double it until `r` is stable.\n\n>Solution to the Application Challenge\n\nHere is the complete Python code implementing the solution for the new parameters.

By increasing the rod length L significantly, the space step Δx became larger. Since Δx is squared in the denominator of the stability parameter r, this drastically increased the tendency for r to be large. To counteract this, the number of time steps nt had to be substantially increased (to 8000 in this solution) to make Δt small enough to keep r below the 0.5 threshold. This is a critical lesson in numerical methods: changing one parameter often necessitates adjusting others to maintain a valid simulation.\n\n- Slower Diffusion: Comparing the plots to the first example, we can see that even though the simulation ran for a much longer time (2.0s vs 0.1s), the heat has not reached the ends of the rod. This is because the rod is much longer (3.2m vs 1.0m). Heat diffusion is a relatively slow process, and the increased distance means it takes significantly more time for the thermal energy to propagate.\n\n- Amplitude and Profile: The initial peak temperature of 300°C drops very quickly, as the heat immediately begins to flow into the adjacent, colder sections of the rod. The resulting temperature profiles are wider and flatter compared to the first example at equivalent early stages, which is characteristic of diffusion over a larger domain. \n\n**Result**\n\nThe overall behavior remains physically consistent, demonstrating the robustness of the FTCS method when its stability condition is respected.\n\n----\n\n## Second order 1D Wave Equation- Theoretical Background\n\n{{<video https://youtu.be/9TQCKWWAVjM?si=RYfufQo0Jb0NJP4y>}}\n\n## Experiment 4: The Second-Order 1D Wave Equation\n\nThis experiment moves from first-order to second-order hyperbolic PDEs by tackling the classic one-dimensional wave equation. This equation models a vast range of physical phenomena, including the vibrations of a guitar string, pressure waves in a tube, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a transmission line.\n\n### Aim\n\nTo solve the one-dimensional wave equation using the finite difference method with an explicit time-stepping scheme.\n\n### Objectives\n\n*   To solve the second-order wave equation for a 1D domain with given initial and boundary conditions.\n*   To implement the central difference scheme for both time and space derivatives.\n*   To understand the role of initial displacement and initial velocity.\n*   To simulate wave propagation and reflection and observe how waves evolve over time.\n\n\n### Governing Equation and Discretization\n\nThe second-order, one-dimensional wave equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the displacement at position `x` and time `t`, and `c` is the constant wave propagation speed.\n\nTo solve this numerically, we use a **central difference** approximation for both derivatives:\n*   *Time Derivative:* $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} \\approx \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u_i^{n-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2}$\n*   *Space Derivative:* $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}$\n\nSubstituting these into the governing equation and solving for the future displacement $u_i^{n+1}$ gives the explicit update formula.\n\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1.  **Discretize the Domain:**\n    *   Divide the spatial domain of length `L` into discrete points using a step size $\\Delta x$.\n    *   Divide the time domain of total duration `T` using a time step $\\Delta t$.\n\n2.  **Stability Check (CFL Condition):**\n    *   Calculate the **Courant Number**, $C = \\frac{c \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$.\n    *   For this explicit scheme to be stable, the Courant number must satisfy $C \\le 1$. If $C > 1$, the numerical solution will grow without bound and become meaningless.\n\n3.  **Set Initial Conditions:**\n    *   This is a second-order equation in time, so we need **two** initial conditions:\n        1.  Initial displacement: $u(x, 0) = f(x)$\n        2.  Initial velocity: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = g(x)$\n\n4.  **Set Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   Assume the boundaries of the domain are fixed (e.g., the ends of a guitar string). This is a **Dirichlet boundary condition**: $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$ for all time `t`.\n\n5.  **Time-stepping Loop:**\n    *   The update rule requires information from two previous time steps (`n` and `n-1`). This poses a problem for the very first step (`n=1`), as we don't have a state at `n=-1`. We use a special formula for the first step derived from the initial velocity condition. For zero initial velocity, this simplifies.\n    *   For all subsequent time steps (`n > 1`), use the main finite difference formula:\n    $$\n    u_i^{n+1} = 2u_i^n - u_i^{n-1} + C^2 \\left( u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n \\right)\n    $$\n\n6.  **Plot and Visualize:**\n    *   After solving for all time steps, plot the wave's displacement `u(x)` at different time instances to observe its motion and reflection.\n\n\n### Application Problem and Python Implementation\n\n**Problem:** The vibration of a stretched string under tension is governed by the 1D wave equation. We are tasked with modeling the vibration of a string of length `L=1.0m` stretched between two fixed points. The string is given an initial displacement in the shape of a sine wave, $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, but *zero initial velocity*.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-wave-equation-string .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.

This is physically accurate: when a wave on a string hits a fixed end, it reflects back with opposite polarity.\n\n- Final State (t=2.0s): After one full period of oscillation, the wave has traveled to both ends, reflected, and returned to its original position and shape, demonstrating the periodic nature of the solution.\n- Stability: The CFL number was calculated as $C=0.5$ , which satisfies the stability condition , $C\\leq 1$. This ensures that the solution remains bounded and physically realistic.\n\n- Numerical Dispersion: While not highly prominent in this example due to the smooth initial condition, some slight changes in the wave's shape might be observed over longer simulation times. This is known as numerical dispersion, an artifact where different frequency components of the wave travel at slightly different speeds in the numerical grid.\n\n**Result**\n\nThe explicit finite difference method accurately captures the key dynamics of wave propagation and reflection, making it a powerful tool for analyzing such systems.\n\n---\n\n## Application Challenge: Vibration in a Flexible Robot Link\n\nIn modern robotics, lightweight materials are used to create fast and efficient robots. However, these materials are often flexible. When a motor at the base of a robot link starts or stops suddenly, it can induce a longitudinal (compression/expansion) wave that travels down the link, causing vibrations at the end-effector (the robot's tool or gripper). This vibration can severely impact the robot's precision.\n\nWe can model this phenomenon using the 1D wave equation, where `u(x,t)` now represents the longitudinal displacement of the material from its resting position.\n\n![Sudden motor movement](sudden-motor-movement.png)\n\n#### Your Task\n\nModel the vibration in a **2.0-meter long** flexible robot link.\n*   *Physical Setup:*\n    *   *Base (x=0):* Connected to a motor. We will model a sudden \"jolt\" by giving the base a brief, sharp displacement and then returning it to zero.\n    *   *End-Effector (x=L):* The end of the link is free to move. This is a *Neumann boundary condition*, which physically means the stress at the end is zero, or $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(L, t) = 0$.\n*   *Initial Conditions:* The link is initially at rest.\n    *   Initial displacement $u(x,0) = 0$.\n    *   Initial velocity $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$.\n*   **Wave Speed:** The speed of sound (and thus stress waves) in this material is $c = 50$ m/s.\n\n#### The Challenge\n\n1.  *Implement a New Boundary Condition:* The motor's jolt can be modeled by forcing the displacement at the base, `u[n, 0]`, to be a short pulse. For example, a sine pulse for a very short duration at the beginning of the simulation.\n2.  *Implement the \"Free End\" (Neumann) Boundary:* The condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(L, t) = 0$ can be approximated with a finite difference as $\\frac{u_{nx-1}^n - u_{nx-2}^n}{\\Delta x} = 0$, which simplifies to $u_{nx-1}^n = u_{nx-2}^n$. This means the last point always has the same displacement as the point next to it. You must enforce this at every time step.\n3.  *Analyze the Result:* Plot the displacement of the *end-effector (`u[:, -1]`)* over time to see how it vibrates in response to the motor's jolt.\n\n#### Hints\n\n*   *Motor Jolt:* You can create the motor jolt inside the time-stepping loop. Use an `if` condition to apply the pulse only for a short time (e.g., when `n*dt < pulse_duration`). A simple pulse could be `u[n, 0] = A * np.sin(omega * n * dt)`.\n\n*   *Neumann Boundary:* After the main update loop for the interior points, add a line to enforce the free-end condition: `u[n + 1, -1] = u[n + 1, -2]`. The `-1` index refers to the last element, and `-2` refers to the second-to-last.\n\n*   *Stability:* With a high wave speed (`c=50`), you will need a very small time step `dt` to satisfy the CFL condition ($C \\le 1$). Be prepared to use a large `nt`.\n\n### Solution to the Robotics Application Challenge\n\nHere is the Python code that models the robot link vibration, incorporating the driving pulse at the base and the free-end boundary condition.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-robot-link-vibration .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.
